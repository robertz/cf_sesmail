cf_sesmail

ABOUT:
cf_sesmail is a custom tag to make sending emails through the Amazon SES 
gateway as painless as possible. I have tried to match the attributes
as close to cfmail as possible so it would be easy to use it as a drop in
replacement.

USAGE:

<cf_sesmail from="user@domain" to="user@domain" subject="test" credentials="/path/to/file">
Mail body
</cf_sesmail>

ATTRIBUTES:

From		String	Required (email address)
To		String	Required (comma separated list of email addresses)
CC		String 	(comma separated list of email addresses)
BCC		String	(comma separated list of email addresses)
FailTo		String	(email address)
ReplyTo		String	(email address)
Subject		String 	Required
MailerID	String	(this value is the User-Agent header, default:cf_sesmail)
EndPoint	String 	(not currently used)
Credentials	String	Required
Name		String	(variable to store results to)
SendHeaders	Struct	

When the tag is called it stores the results in a variables called "sesResults"
and can be overridden by passing the "name" parameter.

The sendHeaders attribute will allow you to pass a structure that contains the
headers that will be applied to the message. Attribute values will be over
written with values from sendHeaders (i.e., MailerID, ReplyTo, FailTo values).

INSTALLATION:

Railo: 
Copy the included Java AWS SDK jar file into your Railo classpath. On linux this

library.
